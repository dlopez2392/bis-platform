/**
 * Internal roadmap labels must not reach a screen a client can open.
 *
 * The defect this file exists to stop: /calendar told every client "Calendar
 * is coming in M2". Three things wrong with one string, and no gate could see
 * any of them — it was present, correct, and rendered exactly as written.
 *   1. "M2" is an internal roadmap label. It means nothing to the reader.
 *   2. It promises a delivery the reader cannot evaluate or hold us to.
 *   3. The numbering has since DRIFTED, so it is wrong even internally: what
 *      shipped under the name M2 was client access, while the spec's M2 is the
 *      booking module the string was actually promising. A reader cannot tell
 *      which one it meant.
 *
 * Same class as the branding-panel slip that `panel-copy.test.ts` pins —
 * internal language surviving onto a client-facing surface — which is why it
 * gets a guard rather than just a fix.
 *
 * A client's sidebar is six items (Dashboard, Contacts, Opportunities,
 * Conversations, Forms, Calendar) plus their own Branding page. Everything
 * else is gated: Settings and the activation checklist by
 * `requireAgencyOnlyAccountAccess`, the dashboard's checklist panel by an
 * `isAgency` branch, and Companies/Blueprints by the agency-only shell.
